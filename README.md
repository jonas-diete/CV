## Skills

#### Detailed Planning to ensure consistency and save time

- Adapting plans when necessary to accomodate unforseen problems

- When working with other students on the engineering project Acebook during the Makers bootcamp, I drew out the database tables, including all the data we might need, the different routes our project will contain and what each of them looks like. We then kept on referring and adding to this design throughout the project to help maintain consistency amongst the team

- This often involves taking a break and doing something entirely different to come back and look at the problem with fresh eyes
