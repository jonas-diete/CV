## Jonas Diete

Software Developer with background in teaching. I love building software - it's truly "creative" and feels amazing to make something new that really works and that people can use. Previously I spent 8 Years of fostering an excitement for learning in children - the challenge of getting better at something is so beautiful.

## Skills

#### Detailed Planning to ensure consistency and save time

- Planning in detail for what can happen during a day/week or term as a teacher
- Planning as a programmer for a project - deciding on which classes to use and how they work together, drawing diagrams, deciding naming and main methods
- Adapting plans when necessary to accomodate unforseen problems
- Leading the Easter Performance at Cypress Primary School -  planning in detail the three classes' acting, singing and backdrop production, then leading the rehearsals for two weeks. This resulted in a memorable performance that was quoted by many parents as the best ever school show
- When working with other students on the engineering project Acebook during the Makers bootcamp, I drew out the database tables, including all the data we might need, the different routes our project will contain and what each of them looks like. We then kept on referring and adding to this design throughout the project to help maintain consistency amongst the team

#### Teamwork 

I am a brilliant team player due to my empathy and patience.

- When developing my TimesTableCoach, my online times table game, I had to solve various problems
- This often involves taking a break and doing something entirely different to come back and look at the problem with fresh eyes
- As a class teacher I often had to solve practical problems like how to effectively seat the children, so they don't destract each other, but still have someone they can work well with
