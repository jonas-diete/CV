# Jonas Diete

Hi :wave: I am a Software Developer with background in teaching. I love building software - it's truly "creative" and feels amazing to make something new that really works and that people can use. Previously I spent 8 Years of fostering an excitement for learning in children - getting better at something is simply beautiful. :hibiscus:

Whilst working at my last school, I rediscovered my passion for coding and spent the last year retraining.  I just graduated from Makers‘ 4 months immersive coding bootcamp and am keen to start working.   

I really enjoy problem solving and working in the tech industry would mean I get a chance to do this all day long!

## :sparkles: Skills

#### :pencil2: :triangular_ruler: Detailed Planning to ensure consistency and save time

When working on Makers team projects:
- Drawing database tables, columns and datatypes, how they are linked, the different routes on Excalidraw
- Continuously referring and adding to this design throughout the project to help maintain consistency amongst the team.
- Adapting plans when necessary to accomodate unforseen problems.

As a class teacher
- Planning for lessons, activities, support, resources, timings on a daily basis.
- Writing Long-term plans to work towards end-of-year goals, exams, performances.

#### :older_woman::man::man_with_turban: Teamwork 

- I enjoy working in collaboration with other developers, discussing structure, strategies and direction for a project.
- Working in pairs to implement features.
- I completed multiple team engineering projects using Agile processes within the Makers bootcamp. 
- Strong communication skills and empathy often helped me - aquired from years working as a school teacher.
- I gathered lots of experience with version control – using git at all times.
- As a class teacher I was regularly working in a team within my year-group.
- Planning lesson progression, sharing best ideas, discussing childrens progress and providing resources for each other.

#### :rocket: Learning

- I am a passionate and effective learner.
- During the last Makers project, I had to learn React Native from scratch and with my team managed to create a working app in just two weeks. 
- This involved lots of independent learning, researching, reading documentations and thorough debugging.
- Before Makers, I taught myself Python and JavaScript by following online tutorials and introduction videos. 
- I enjoy reading other people's code, picking out elements to re-use myself, adapting them and learning through this process.

## :green_heart: Hobbies

**:running: Orienteering:** Reading detailed maps while running through the woods helps me filter information, trains my memory and forces me to make rapid decisions under pressure.   

**:speech_balloon: Languages:** I like learning them and speak :de: German (native), :fr: French (semi-fluent) and :it: Italian (beginner). Learning rules and structures works just like with coding languages.
